    <h1>Goals & Strengths</h1>

    <h2>Short-term goals (next 6–12 months)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Finish practical tasks and deliverables for ongoing projects (complete the Puncher QR-based attendance integration and finish the web admin dashboard).</li>
      <li>Strengthen hands-on cybersecurity skills: take a course or certificate (practical labs), and complete at least two real-world lab tasks (vulnerability scan, basic incident response).</li>
      <li>Improve automation and coding fluency (Python scripting for small tools and automation).</li>
      <li>Build a tidy study portfolio (one consolidated PDF + 10-slide study PPT) for Abnormal Psychology & Cyber Behaviour to use in exams and interviews.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Long-term goals (3–5+ years)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Become a Security Engineer / Team Lead or start a small cybersecurity consultancy focused on practical controls for SMEs.</li>
      <li>Earn an advanced qualification (MSc or professional certs) and publish at least one practical write-up or case study (blog/post or conference).</li>
      <li>Build reusable training material (course or workshop) teaching secure online behaviour to non-technical staff.</li>
      <li>Run a small community project—free monthly security clinic or code lab for beginners.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Strengths</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Practical problem-solver — I prefer hands-on fixes and can move from theory to working prototype quickly.</li>
      <li>Technical foundation in network & cyber security — able to read logs, debug, and implement basic controls.</li>
      <li>Attention to detail — I double-check settings, permissions, and configs.</li>
      <li>Communicative and team-oriented — I document steps and make things repeatable for others.</li>
      <li>Consistent learner — regularly follow new tools, labs, and practical demos.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Weaknesses (and how I mitigate them)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Perfectionism (can spend too long polishing). → I set strict timeboxes and use “minimum viable” deliverables.</li>
      <li>Tendency to multitask on many small projects. → I use a priority list and daily 2–3 focus tasks.</li>
      <li>Public speaking/nervous presenting. → Practice with short mock presentations and record myself.</li>
      <li>Can over-rely on technical solutions, sometimes underweighting the social/human side of security. → I add a stakeholder step to projects (interviews/short surveys).</li>
      <li>Occasionally slow to delegate. → I create simple checklists so I can hand tasks to others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Proof of Critical Thinking — Abnormal Psychology & Cyber Behaviour</h2>
    <p>Below I show the exact steps I used to analyze my own online presence and behaviour using concepts from Abnormal Psychology (biases, social influence) and Cyber Behaviour (digital footprints, social engineering). This is real reasoning shown as a concise audit + action plan.</p>

    <h3>Goal:</h3>
    <p>Evaluate my profiles and online behaviour, identify psychological/cyber risks, and make targeted improvements.</p>

    <h3>Process & Evidence of Thinking</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Inventory (data collection). Made a list of all public accounts (LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, GitHub) and identified where personal phone/email or geolocation was exposed.</li>
      <li>Apply psychological concepts. Looked for signs of online disinhibition and cognitive biases: noted posts that were emotionally charged (likely to invite oversharing). Observed news sources I often repost; checked for confirmation bias.</li>
      <li>Threat model for social engineering. Assessed what an attacker could learn and determined plausible social-engineering vectors.</li>
      <li>Technical controls applied. Moved phone number and personal email out of public bios; put a business contact email on LinkedIn. Enabled 2FA and turned off geotagging.</li>
      <li>Behavioral controls applied. Adopted pause-before-post and source-check routines.</li>
      <li>Reflection & learning. Wrote a short paragraph summarizing what I found and the new habits to keep. Scheduled a quarterly audit of my digital footprint.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion (short)</h3>
    <p>Using abnormal-psychology concepts allowed me to identify why I overshare or re-share certain content, while cyber-behaviour techniques showed how that oversharing becomes an attack vector. The combined approach led to immediate, measurable safeguards (privacy removal, 2FA) and lasting behavioral habits (pause-before-post, source-check).</p>
