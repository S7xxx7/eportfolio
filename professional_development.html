    <h2>2. Mission Statements</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Mission Statement (Research Methods)</h3>
    <p>During my Research Methods phase, my goal was to strengthen my technical foundation and learn how to connect academic knowledge with practical problem-solving. I aimed to build real-world experience by developing small cybersecurity projects and enhancing my ability to analyze technical data and document results professionally. My focus was on becoming consistent, reliable, and methodical — the traits needed for a future IT Security Engineer.</p>

    <h3>2.2 Mission Statement (Research Seminar)</h3>
    <p>By the time of my Research Seminar, my goals had expanded to include leadership and mentorship. I was not only focused on technical performance but also on communication, ethics, and collaboration. I began to plan long-term: leading security teams, running awareness programs, and possibly starting a small consultancy that helps SMEs adopt secure IT practices. I see my education as the training ground for the ethical and professional mindset required to guide others.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> These two statements show growth — from focusing on skill-building to focusing on purpose and impact. My current direction combines both: technical depth and ethical leadership.</p>
