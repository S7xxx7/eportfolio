    <h1>Ethics & Communication</h1>

    <h2>1. Ethical Reasoning</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Evidence: Applying ethical principles in decision-making</h3>
    <p>In my academic and professional work, I’ve had to make decisions that involve privacy, responsibility, and harm reduction. For example: deciding how personal data (like employee or client information) should be stored and who should be allowed access. This was not only a technical question, it was an ethical one.</p>
    <p>I asked: <em>Do we actually need to collect this information? Do the people know how it will be used? Who could be harmed if it leaks?</em> My recommendation was to limit what is collected, clearly state the purpose, protect access, and remove data that is not needed anymore.</p>
    <p class="note">This shows ethical reasoning, not just problem-solving. The goal was to reduce risk for real people, not just make the system “work.”</p>

    <h3>1.2 Reflection: How ethics training shaped my decisions</h3>
    <p>Before ethics training, I focused mainly on functionality and speed. After exposure to professional ethics, incident responsibility, and accountability, I now always ask: <strong>Who is affected by this decision?</strong></p>
    <p>I consider:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Confidentiality — am I protecting someone's private data?</li>
      <li>Consent — were people told? Did they agree?</li>
      <li>Accountability — if something goes wrong, can I defend the choice?</li>
      <li>Fairness — does this create risk for one group so another group can benefit?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This changed my role from “do the task” to “make sure the task is responsible.” That’s professional growth.</p>

    <h3>1.3 Growth in ethical reasoning</h3>
    <p>Earlier in my studies, ethics sounded like “don’t cheat” and “follow the rules.” Now I see ethics as part of leadership. You have to be able to say, “No, this is not acceptable,” and defend that position with logic and respect for people. That confidence is part of why I see myself in future lead or advisory roles.</p>

    <h2>2. Oral and Written Communication</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Written communication</h3>
    <p>In reports and proposals, I follow a structure: state the situation, explain the risk, then provide a recommendation. I avoid buzzwords and try to make the writing useful for someone who is not technical.</p>
    <p><strong>Strengths in my writing:</strong> clarity, logical order, and actionability. I end with concrete next steps so the reader knows exactly what to do.</p>

    <h3>2.2 Oral / presentation communication</h3>
    <p>In spoken presentations, I work on staying calm, using simple language, and leading with the key message. Instead of opening with technical details, I start with: “Here is the problem. Here is why it matters. Here is how we fix it.” This keeps attention and shows impact.</p>
    <p>I also adjust language depending on who is listening — technical staff vs non-technical staff. This helps avoid confusion and builds trust.</p>

    <h3>2.3 Growth in communication</h3>
    <p>At first, I used to overload with details. I wanted to prove knowledge. Now I understand that professional communication is not about sounding complex; it's about being understood. I focus on relevance, confidence, and next steps.</p>

    <h2>3. How this supports my professional development</h2>
    <p>Both areas — ethical reasoning and communication — are critical for where I am going. Roles like Security Engineer, Team Lead, or consultant require two things beyond technical skill:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The ability to make ethical decisions that protect people and the organization.</li>
      <li>The ability to communicate risks and solutions so that others can act.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I am actively building both. This is the foundation of leadership: responsibility + clarity.</p>
